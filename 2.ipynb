    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used in feature engineering where categorical variables are encoded in such a way that the categories are ordered based on the target variable, typically in the context of supervised learning. This method can be particularly useful when the categorical variable is nominal (no inherent order) but you want to create an order based on the target variable to extract more meaningful insights for the model.\n",

    "How Target Guided Ordinal Encoding Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate Means: For each category in the categorical variable, calculate the mean of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Order Categories: Order the categories based on the calculated means. This can be either ascending or descending, but typically, categories are ordered such that higher means get higher ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign Numbers: Replace the categories with ordinal numbers based on this ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Usage in a Machine Learning Project:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are working on a machine learning project to predict the price of used cars. Your dataset includes a categorical variable 'Car Brand' (like Toyota, BMW, Honda) and your target variable is the 'Price'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate Mean Prices: For each car brand, calculate the mean price of the cars in the dataset. Suppose the mean prices are BMW - $20,000, Toyota - $15,000, Honda - $12,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Order Brands by Mean Price: Order the car brands by these mean prices. Here, the order would be BMW > Toyota > Honda.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace with Ordinal Numbers: Encode these brands with ordinal numbers reflecting this order, e.g., BMW (3), Toyota (2), Honda (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "This encoding method is particularly useful when you suspect that the categorical variable has an impact on the target variable, but the categories themselves don't have a natural order. By encoding them based on the target variable, you can potentially improve the model's ability to capture this relationship. In our example, the encoding reflects the average price association with each car brand, which might be more informative for a predictive model than simple one-hot or label encoding."
